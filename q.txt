Objective:
Create an API that takes an array of integers and a target value, and returns all pairs of indices
where the sum of the elements at those indices equals the target value.
Requirements:
1. Endpoint: /find-pairs
• Method: POST
• Request Body:
• Accepts a JSON object with the following structure:

Request
{
&quot;numbers&quot;: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
&quot;target&quot;: 6
}
• numbers: An array of integers.
• target: An integer representing the target sum.
Response:
Returns a JSON object with the following structure:
{
&quot;solutions&quot;: [
[0, 4],
[1, 3]
]
}
Ex: numbers[0] + numbers[4] = 1 + 5 = 6. Which is matching the target
solutions: An array of arrays, where each sub-array contains two integers representing the indices
of the elements in the numbers array whose sum equals the target. If no such pairs exist, return an
empty array [].

• Edge Cases:
• The array might contain duplicate numbers.
• The array might be empty.
• The target might not match the sum of any two elements in the array.
• Validation:
• The API should validate the input to ensure that the numbers array contains only
integers and the target is an integer.
• If the input is invalid, the API should return an appropriate error message with a 400
status code.

• Performance:
• Optimize the API to handle large arrays efficiently.
• It should be able to handle multiple requests parallely.

Evaluation Criteria:
• Correctness: Does the API correctly find and return all pairs of indices?
• Code Quality: Is the code clean, well-structured, and maintainable?
• Performance: Is the solution optimized for large inputs?
• Testing: Are there comprehensive tests covering different scenarios?
• Documentation: Is the code well-documented with clear instructions?
